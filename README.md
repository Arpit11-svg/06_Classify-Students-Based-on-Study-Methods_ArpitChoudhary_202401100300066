About the Project
This project is focused on analyzing and classifying students based on their preferred study methods. The goal is to understand how students learn best â€” whether they are Visual, Auditory, or Kinesthetic learners â€” using their responses from a questionnaire.

By using both classification and clustering algorithms, the project helps:

Predict a student's learning style based on scores

Group similar learners together using patterns in the data

This kind of analysis can be useful in educational planning, personalized teaching, and adaptive learning platforms.

ðŸ¤– Algorithm Used
ðŸ”¹ Random Forest Classifier (Supervised Learning)
Purpose: To predict the studentâ€™s learning style (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic).

Why Used: Itâ€™s accurate, handles mixed types of data, and reduces overfitting using multiple decision trees.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness

Precision: How precise the model is when it says a student is a particular type

Recall: How many actual students of a type the model found

F1-Score: Balance between precision and recall

Confusion Matrix: To visualize correct vs. incorrect predictions

ðŸ”¹ K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
Purpose: To group students into clusters based on their study method scores, even without knowing their actual learning styles.

Why Used: It helps discover natural groupings and hidden patterns in the data.

Process:

Data was scaled using StandardScaler

Clustering was done with 3 clusters (based on 3 learning styles)
